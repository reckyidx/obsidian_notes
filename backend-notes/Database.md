##### 1. Object Relationship Mapping (ORM)

	Map between object in programming and table in relationship database
		 Pros: CRUD interaction without SQl, Migration, Association (1-1, 1-many,                many- many), lazy loading(load data when needed), Transaction                     support, Query builders)
