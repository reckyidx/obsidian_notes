1. What is Javascript? 
		High Level, Interpreting programimg language, dynamically type language (checks variable types at runtime, not at compile time), non blocking I/O. It is a single threaded but achieves concurrency through event loop and asynchronous API. 
		- code runs inside a execution context (global, block or function scope). 
		- CallStack manages the function call and heap handles store object.
		- single threaded, event loop and task queue enable async programming. Non blocking and make it efficient for network heavy apps
		- programming paradigm(way of writing code) - 
			- imperative programing(step by step instruction)
			- Functional programming
			- object oriented programming (uses object and inheritence)
			-
		-  Ecamscript - standard specification for scripting language 
		- Runs on browser engine , v8 (chrome, opera), spider monkey(firefox)
		- compliler - interpreted languages , modern js -> combination of interpretation + Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation techniques
