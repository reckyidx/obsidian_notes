### **I. JavaScript Deep Dive: The Bedrock**

#### **1. Execution Context, Lexical Environment & Scope**
*   **Execution Context:** An abstract environment where JavaScript code is evaluated and executed. Every function call creates a new context.
*   **Lexical Environment:** A specification object that stores the mapping of **identifier names (variables/functions) to their values and a reference to its *outer* lexical environment**. This linkage forms the **scope chain**.
    ```javascript
    function outer() {
      var x = 10; // Stored in outer's lexical environment
      function inner() {
        // inner's lexical environment has a reference to outer's environment.
        // This is how it finds `x`.
        console.log(x); // 10
      }
      inner();
    }
    outer();
    ```
    The interpreter searches the scope chain until it finds the variable or reaches the global scope. If not found, a `ReferenceError` is thrown.
*   **Closures:** A direct consequence of lexical scoping. It's a function that **"closes over"** its outer lexical environment, retaining access to variables from that scope even after the outer function has finished executing.
    ```javascript
    function createCounter() {
      let count = 0; // `count` is closed over by the inner function
      return function() {
        count++;
        return count;
      };
    }
    const counter = createCounter();
    console.log(counter()); // 1
    console.log(counter()); // 2
    ```
    **Benefits:** Data encapsulation, module patterns, currying, and maintaining state in event handlers/callbacks.

#### **2. `this` Keyword & Binding Rules**
The value of `this` is determined by how a function is called:
1.  **Default Binding:** `this` refers to the global object (or `undefined` in strict mode). (e.g., `foo()`)
2.  **Implicit Binding:** `this` refers to the object calling the method. (e.g., `obj.foo()`)
3.  **Explicit Binding:** Forcibly set `this` using `call`, `apply`, or `bind`. (e.g., `foo.call(obj)`)
4.  **`new` Binding:** `this` refers to the newly created instance inside a constructor function. (e.g., `new Foo()`)
5.  **Arrow Functions:** Do not have their own `this`. They lexically inherit `this` from their surrounding scope.

#### **3. Prototypal Inheritance**
*   **Prototype Chain:** Objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects via their internal `[[Prototype]]` link (accessed via `__proto__` or `Object.getPrototypeOf()`).
*   **`prototype` Property:** Every function has a `prototype` property. When a function is used as a constructor with `new`, the new object's `__proto__` is set to the constructor's `prototype`.
*   **ES6 Classes:** Syntactic sugar over the prototype-based inheritance model.

#### **4. Functions vs. Methods**
*   **Function:** A standalone block of code not associated with an object. It is declared and called independently.
    ```javascript
    function greet() { return "Hello!"; }
    const greet = function() { ... }; // Function expression
    ```
*   **Method:** A function that is a property of an object and is called in the context of that object.
    ```javascript
    const obj = {
      greet: function() { return `Hello, ${this.name}!`; }
    };
    obj.greet(); // Method call
    ```

#### **5. Compilation in JavaScript/Node.js**
*   **JIT (Just-In-Time) Compilation (V8 Engine):** Source code is first parsed into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The interpreter (Ignition) quickly converts this to bytecode for execution. The optimizing compiler (Turbofan) analyzes hot code paths (frequently run code) and compiles them down to highly optimized machine code for subsequent executions.
*   **Native Addons:** C++ modules are compiled into `.node` files using `node-gyp`, which uses compilers like **GCC** or **Clang**.
*   **Transpiler (e.g., Babel):** A source-to-source compiler that converts modern ES6+ code into backwards-compatible ES5 code that can run in older JS engines. It handles syntax, not machine code.

### **II. The Node.js Runtime & Advanced Concepts**

#### **1. Event Loop Mastery**
*   **Phases:** Timers (`setInterval`, `setTimeout`) → Pending Callbacks (I/O) → Idle/Prepare → **Poll** (retrieve new I/O events) → Check (`setImmediate`) → Close Callbacks.
*   **Macrotasks vs. Microtasks:**
    *   **Macrotasks:** `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `setImmediate`, I/O callbacks.
    *   **Microtasks:** `process.nextTick()`, `Promise` callbacks, `queueMicrotask()`.
    *   **Rule:** The event loop processes the **microtask queue to completion** after each macrotask and in-between each callback during a phase.
    ```javascript
    console.log('1');
    setTimeout(() => console.log('2'), 0);
    Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('3'));
    process.nextTick(() => console.log('4')); // Highest priority microtask
    console.log('5');
    // Output: 1, 5, 4, 3, 2
    ```

#### **2. Performance & Scalability**
*   **Clustering:** Use the `cluster` module to fork multiple worker processes, leveraging all CPU cores. Workers share nothing; use a shared store like **Redis** for state.
*   **Worker Threads:** For offloading CPU-intensive tasks (hashing, image processing). They allow sharing memory via `SharedArrayBuffer` but do not replace the `cluster` module for I/O scaling.
*   **Streams & Backpressure:** Handle large datasets efficiently. Streams automatically manage backpressure by pausing and resuming data flow.
*   **Caching:** Implement in-memory (LRU-cache) or distributed (Redis) caching to reduce latency and database load.

#### **3. Core API Deep Dive**
*   **Child Processes:** `spawn` (for long-running processes with streaming I/O), `exec` (for short commands with buffered output), `fork` (a special `spawn` for Node.js scripts enabling IPC).
*   **Buffer & Memory Management:** Working with binary data. Understand the security implications of the older `Buffer` constructor.
*   **Event Emitter:** The foundational pattern for handling events in Node.js (e.g., `net.Server`, `stream.Readable`). Know how to implement your own.

#### **4. Asynchronous Patterns**
*   **Promise Patterns:** `Promise.all()` (fail-fast), `Promise.allSettled()` (wait for all), `Promise.race()` (first to settle).
*   **Async Local Storage (ALS):** Provides a way to store context (e.g., user session, request ID) throughout the lifetime of a synchronous or asynchronous operation, replacing the deprecated `domain` module.

### **III. Security Best Practices (AppSec)**
*   **OWASP Top 10:** Understand and mitigate common vulnerabilities.
    *   **Injection:** Use parameterized queries (e.g., with Knex, Sequelize) for SQL; avoid evaluating user input for NoSQL.
    *   **XSS:** Sanitize user input with libraries like `dompurify` (client-side) and `xss` (server-side). Always escape output.
    *   **Broken Authentication:** Implement strong password hashing (**bcrypt, scrypt, argon2**), secure session management, and JWT best practices.
*   **Helmet.js:** Essential Express middleware that sets various security HTTP headers (like `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Strict-Transport-Security`).
*   **CORS:** Configure properly to control which domains can access your resources. Don't simply enable it for all origins (`{ origin: '*' }`).
*   **Dependency Scanning:** Integrate tools like `npm audit`, `Snyk`, or `Dependabot` into your CI/CD pipeline to find and fix vulnerable dependencies.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Protect against DoS and brute-force attacks using middleware like `express-rate-limit` or a Redis-based solution.

### **IV. Software Architecture & Design**

#### **1. Low-Level Design (LLD) / OOPS**
*   **SOLID Principles:**
    *   **S:** Single Responsibility (One class, one reason to change).
    *   **O:** Open/Closed (Open for extension, closed for modification).
    *   **L:** Liskov Substitution (Subtypes must be replaceable for their base types).
    *   **I:** Interface Segregation (Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose one).
    *   **D:** Dependency Inversion (Depend on abstractions, not concretions).
*   **Design Patterns:**
    *   **Singleton:** Ensure a class has only one instance (e.g., database connection pool).
    *   **Factory:** Create objects without specifying the exact class.
    *   **Observer/Pub-Sub:** For building event-driven systems.
    *   **Adapter:** Allows incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
*   **Sample Problem:** Design a parking lot, chess game, logger, or in-memory cache with LRU eviction.

#### **2. System Design & Architecture**
*   **Microservices vs. Monolith:** Understand the trade-offs in complexity, scalability, and deployability.
*   **Communication:** How will services talk? REST APIs, gRPC (for performance), or message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka for decoupling and resilience).
*   **State Management:** Design stateless APIs for horizontal scaling. Store session state in a shared store like **Redis**.
*   **Database Design:** SQL vs. NoSQL choice, indexing strategies, sharding, and replication.
*   **Sample Problems:** Design a URL shortener, a real-time collaborative editor, or a notification system.

### **V. Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**
*   **Why it matters:** For writing efficient code, optimizing database interactions, and solving complex problems.
*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **Big O Notation:** Analyze time and space complexity.
    *   **Data Structures:** Know the practical use cases and implementations of:
        *   **Arrays & Strings**
        *   **Hash Maps (Objects/Sets):** For O(1) lookups.
        *   **Stacks & Queues**
        *   **Linked Lists**
        *   **Trees (BST, Tries) & Graphs**
    *   **Algorithms:**
        *   Sorting, Searching (Binary Search)
        *   Recursion
        *   BFS & DFS
        *   Dynamic Programming & Memoization
*   **Sample Questions:** Implement a rate limiter (Sliding Window algorithm), reverse a linked list, validate a BST, find anagrams.

### **VI. Testing, DevOps & Operational Excellence**

#### **1. Testing & Quality**
*   **Testing Pyramid:** Many unit tests, fewer integration tests, even fewer E2E tests.
*   **Test Doubles:** Mocks (verify interactions), Stubs (control input), Spies (record function calls).
*   **Tools:** Jest, Mocha/Chai, Supertest (for HTTP integration tests).
*   **Static Analysis:** Use ESLint and Prettier for consistent code style. Use TypeScript to catch errors at compile time.

#### **2. DevOps & Operations**
*   **Docker:** Create efficient, minimal images using multi-stage builds and `node:alpine` base images.
*   **Logging:** Use structured JSON logging with libraries like `Pino` or `Winston` for easier querying and analysis.
*   **Monitoring:** Use APM tools (Datadog, New Relic) to track performance metrics and errors.
*   **Graceful Shutdown:** Handle `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` signals to close database connections and finish ongoing requests before the process exits.
*   **Configuration:** Store config in environment variables following the 12-factor app methodology. Never commit secrets.

### **Final Interview Strategy & Advice**

1.  **Communication is Key:** Think aloud. Explain your reasoning, trade-offs, and considerations. The interviewer wants to see your thought process.
2.  **Clarify Ambiguity:** For design questions, ask questions to define scope, scale, and requirements. ("What's the expected QPS?", "What are the read/write patterns?")
3.  **Start Simple, Then Optimize:** For DSA questions, first propose a brute-force solution, then analyze its complexity, and finally optimize it.
4.  **Be Honest:** If you don't know something, say so. Then try to reason based on first principles. "I'm not familiar with X, but based on Y, I would think..."
5.  **Show Passion:** Discuss a recent technical challenge, something you learned, or an area you're excited about.
