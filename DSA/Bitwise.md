Bitwise operator treat argument as 32 bit in order to perform bitwise 

1. AND	
	
| A   | B   | O/P |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   |
1. OR
			

| 0   | 0   | 0   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   |

   
2. XOR (^)
   

| 0   | 1   | 1   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   |

   
3. Not (~)
	   

| 0   | 1   |
| --- | --- |
| 1   | 0   |

3. Left shift (<<)
		shifts the bits to left side and fills the space with 0's
			
4. right shift (>>)
		
5. zero fill right shift(>>>)
