1. To find prime number use 
   ### Sieve of Eratosthenes
	   
2. Find mid value in binary search  using this formula. 
```
mid = start + (end - start) / 2
```
	This helps in avoiding integer overflowing for exa,ple start = int.max ,  
	end = int.max. Both sum results in out of safe integer. so better use above       formula. answer will in safe process
