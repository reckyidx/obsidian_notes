Got it 👍 I’ll polish and restructure your notes so they read clean, professional, and easy to review later. I’ll also fix grammar/spelling, improve flow, and organize things into clearer sections.

# 📘 Low-Level Design (LLD) Notes

### 🔹 What is LLD?

Low-Level Design (LLD) is a phase in the software development process where **detailed system components and their interactions** are specified.  
It involves converting **High-Level Design (HLD)** into a more detailed blueprint that addresses:

- Specific algorithms
    
- Data structures
    
- Interfaces
    
- Grouping of data and behaviors into objects
    

### 🔹 Key Components of LLD

1. **Object-Oriented Principles** – Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism
2. **Analysis & Design Process** – Breaking down modules into classes, methods, and interactions
3. **Design Patterns** – Reusable solutions to common design problems
4. **UML Diagrams** – Class diagrams, sequence diagrams, activity diagrams
5. **SOLID Principles** – Ensuring modularity, scalability, and maintainability

### 🔹 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Focuses on writing **modular, scalable, and reusable** code by modeling real-world entities as objects.

### 🔹 Coding Practice

**FIFO Async Task Queue (Promises-based implementation)**

```js
class TaskQueue {
  constructor() {
    this.queue = [];
    this.running = false;
  }

  // Add a task to the queue
  add(task) {
    this.queue.push(task);
    this.run(); // trigger execution
  }

  // Executes one task at a time (FIFO)
  async run() {
    if (this.running) return;
    this.running = true;

    while (this.queue.length > 0) {
      const task = this.queue.shift();
      try {
        await task();
      } catch (err) {
        console.error("Task error:", err);
      }
    }

    this.running = false;
  }
}

// Usage Example
const queue = new TaskQueue();

function createTask(name, time) {
  return () =>
    new Promise((resolve) => {
      console.log(`Starting: ${name}`);
      setTimeout(() => {
        console.log(`Finished: ${name}`);
        resolve();
      }, time);
    });
}

// Add tasks
queue.add(createTask("Task 1", 1000));
queue.add(createTask("Task 2", 500));
queue.add(createTask("Task 3", 200));
```

✅ This version keeps your notes **clean, organized, and professional**, while also making them easy to revise before interviews.

Do you want me to also create a **visual mindmap-style summary (PDF/diagram)** of these notes so you can glance through quickly before interviews?
