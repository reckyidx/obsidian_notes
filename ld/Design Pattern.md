	
Creational
How objects are created provided flexible and efficient ways to instantiate them without specifying the exact details of creation process.
- abstract factory
	 Provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes
- Factory
	 Defines an interface for creating an object, but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate
- Builder
	 Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations
- Prototype
	 Creates new objects by copying an existing object, avoiding subclassing
- Singleton
	 Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it
	    
	 
Behavioural
Object interacted focusing on communication and responsibility
- Chain of Responsibility
- command
- interpreter
- observer
- state
- strategy
- template
- visitor

Structural
combine or arrange class and object to form larger structure that solve specific problem

- adapter
	Converts the interface of one class into another that a client expects
- bridge
	Separates an object's abstraction from its implementation
- composite
	Creates a tree structure of objects, allowing you to treat simple and complex elements uniformly
- decorator
	Dynamically adds responsibilities to objects
- facade
	Provides a simplified interface to a complex system
- flyweight
	Enables the efficient sharing of objects with minimal memory usage
- proxy
	Provides a placeholder for another object, allowing you to control access or add functionality
